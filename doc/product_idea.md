# Product Idea: The Witty AI Cooking Companion

## Product Description

An AI-powered cooking companion, delivered as a Telegram bot, that makes mealtime fun, creative, and healthy. The assistant begins by engaging users with funny, surprising, and experimental recipes, often combining ingredients in unexpected (but cookable) ways. 

As users interact more, the AI cleverly transitions into a knowledgeable meal and recipe advisor, gently guiding them towards healthier eating habits. It supports multi-modal inputs (text, photo, audio) to create a seamless and engaging experience. Designed with privacy as a priority, it can work with local models to ensure user data remains secure.

## Main Functions

### User Input and Understanding
1.  **Multi-Modal Input**: Process user requests via text, photo (e.g., of ingredients in the fridge), and audio messages for maximum convenience.
2.  **Ingredient Recognition**: Automatically identify ingredients from user photos or text descriptions.
3.  **Comprehensive Preference Analysis**: Understand and structure user needs, including dietary preferences, personal goals, cuisine tastes, mood, and location.
4.  **Language Detection**: Detect the user's language and respond accordingly (e.g., English, Russian, Dutch, French).

### Personalization and Interaction
5.  **Adaptive Persona**: Starts with a witty, joking persona to create a fun experience, and gradually introduces more supportive, advisory tones as it learns about the user's goals.
6.  **Contextual Conversations**: Maintain conversation context to support multi-turn dialogues and refine user needs.
7.  **User Journey Management**: Guides the user from simple, fun recipes to more advanced or healthier meal planning over time.
8.  **Clarification and Confirmation**: Engage in a dialogue to clarify needs and summarize preferences for confirmation before generating a recipe.
